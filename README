This project is very straightforward. I think this router project
is very challening and more interesting compared to project 1.

About the implementation, I follow exactly what describe in RFC about
all the headers.

To make everything easier, I define different structs for different
headers instead of using the general one provided the original code. I
also break the logic into different files to easily keep track and
debug.
